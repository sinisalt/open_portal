# shadcn/ui Components

This directory contains shadcn/ui components installed via CLI.

**DO NOT manually create files here.** Use:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

Components are installed incrementally as widgets are implemented.

See: documentation/WIDGET-COMPONENT-MAPPING.md for the installation plan.
