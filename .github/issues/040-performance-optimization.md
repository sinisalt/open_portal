# Issue #042: Performance Optimization and Code Splitting

**Phase:** Phase 4 - Scale & Governance  
**Weeks:** 26-27  
**Component:** Frontend  
**Estimated Effort:** 5 days  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** phase-4, frontend, performance, optimization

## Description
Implement performance optimizations including code splitting by route, lazy loading of widgets, bundle size optimization, render performance tuning, and CDN setup for configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Code splitting by route
- [ ] Lazy loading of widgets
- [ ] Bundle size analysis and optimization
- [ ] Tree shaking optimization
- [ ] Render performance profiling and tuning
- [ ] Memoization strategies
- [ ] Virtualized lists/tables
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] CDN setup for static configs
- [ ] Service Worker for offline support

## Performance Targets
- First contentful paint: <1s
- Time to interactive: <2s
- Bundle size: <300KB (gzipped)
- Widget render: <30ms average
- Re-render optimization: <16ms (60fps)

## Dependencies
- Depends on: All frontend components

## Deliverables
- Optimized build configuration
- Lazy loading implementation
- Performance monitoring
- Documentation
