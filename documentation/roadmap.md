# Implementation Roadmap

## Development Workflow

**Issue-Driven Development:** This roadmap is implemented through structured issue files (`ISSUE-XXX-*.md`) in the project root. Each issue contains detailed development steps. When completing an issue:
1. Follow the steps defined in the issue file
2. Create an `ISSUE-XXX-COMPLETION.md` file documenting deliverables
3. **Update this roadmap** by marking completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Commit changes with issue reference

**Progress Tracking:** All checkboxes `[ ]` in this roadmap should be updated to `[x]` as tasks are completed. This ensures the roadmap reflects the actual project status.

## Project Phases

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the OpenPortal platform, from planning through production deployment.

---

## Phase 0: Discovery & Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
